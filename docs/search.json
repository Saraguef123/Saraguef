    "text": "Enviormental Science 144\nThis course taken at UCSB was about rivers and understanding the different river process and human use of rivers. One important part of the class was a one day field trip to observe the Mission Creek watershed located in Santa Barbara, California. We observed the watershed starting from its headwaters and down to the rivers outlet. Our main objective for this field trip was to observe the hydrygeomorphology at each site and observe the human impacts on the river. We stopped at 6 sites starting up from the mountains down to the pacific ocean.\n\nMap of Mission Creek Watershed\nThis map shows the sites we observed along the Mission Creek Watershed. In orange it shows the delineated watershed. The blue markers represent the individual sites we observed. When you click on the blue markers it will give you a brief description of what we observed as we move to each site."

This took me a week to complete. The second part of this process was to start doing research. I spent 2 weeks gathering and synthesizing information on the topic in order to move forward with essay. Th last step of this process was to start writing the essay, and make sure to utilize the critical thinking skills I learned through out the quarter."
