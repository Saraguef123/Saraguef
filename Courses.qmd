## Earth Science 2

One of my favorite courses taken at UCSB is Earth Science 2. It was my first exposure to geology and I learned a lot about earths different processes and plate tectonics. I enjoyed going on a one day field trip to the Santa Ynez mountains and observing the different geologic processes.
