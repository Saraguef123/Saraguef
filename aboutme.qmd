I grew up in Santa Barbara, California. I enjoy spending time by the beach and love the weather here. I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree in Hydrologic Sciences and Policy and plan to pursue a career focused on sustainability and environmental protection.



## Photography

I enjoy photography in my free time. I enjoy taking pictures of places I have been or anything that I can capture in the moment. Here are some photos I have taken over the years.

## Baking

I have recently been enjoying baking different kinds of desserts and pastries from all around the world. I enjoy learning the different recipes and cultures behind them. One of my favorites was baking baklava at home which took a lot of time but was very worth it in the end.
