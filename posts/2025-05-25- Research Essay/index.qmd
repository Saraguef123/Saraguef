## ENVS 40 Project

I took Environmental Science 40, a critical thinking course taken at UCSB. For a final project I chose to do a research essay on the effects of lithium mining in the Salar de Atacama region in Chile. One of the main goals for this project was to be able to use and demonstrate critical thinking skills. Throughout the 10 week course I was able to learn about the different kinds of evidence and methods to produce a research essay.

### Process
The process for this project started with making a proposal on what my project was going to look like and how I plan on presenting it. I decided to focus on lithium mining in Chile. This took me a week to complete. The second part of this process was to start doing research. I spent 2 weeks gathering and synthesizing information on the topic in order to move forward with the essay. The last step of this process was to start writing the essay and to make sure to utilize the critical thinking skills I learned through out the quarter. One important part of this process was time management. Through out the course we completed weekly time logs to list fully what was completed that week and to keep track of our progress
