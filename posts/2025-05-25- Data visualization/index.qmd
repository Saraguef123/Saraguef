## Data Visualiation

This code displayed visualizes the time I spend on school work each day of the week. I created a  plot where the day of week is on the x-axis and time spent on homework is non the y-axis. The jittered points represent individually time spent each day. The red points represent the mean time each day spent on school work

```{r eval=FALSE}
mydata$day.of.week <-  factor(mydata$day.of.week, #converts day of week to a factor with specific order
                             levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
                                        "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday",
                                        "Sunday")) 


mean_data <- mydata |> #uses my_data frame
group_by(day.of.week) |> #groups points by day of week
  summarize(mean_time = mean(Time.spent.on.Schoolwork.min.)) #calculates mean time spent on school work for each day of the week
  
ggplot(mydata, #uses mydata frame
       aes(x = day.of.week, #x-axis should be day of week
           y = Time.spent.on.Schoolwork.min., #y-axis should be time spent on school work in min
                   color = day.of.week)) + #coloring geometries by day of week
  
  geom_jitter( width =0.1, #adds points
               height= 0,
               alpha=0.5)+ # points 50% transparent
  geom_point(data=mean_data, aes(y=mean_time), shape = 16, size = 3, color = "red")+#adds a mean point for each day
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Monday" = "magenta", #changes color of points
    "Tuesday" = "orange", #changes color of points 
    "Wednesday" = "gold", #changes color of points
    "Thursday" = "green", #changes color of points
    "Friday" = "darkblue",#changes color of points
    "Saturday"= "black",  #changes color of points
    "Sunday" = "turquoise"  #changes color of points
  ))+
  labs(
    title = " Average Time Spent on School Work by Day of Week", #adds a title
    x = "Day of the Week", #changes x-axis title
    color = "Day of Week", #changes legend title
    y = "Time spent on School Work(min)", #changes y-axis title
    caption = "Figure 1") +#adds a caption 
  theme_bw() #changing theme of plot
```

### Plot

![](/media/datavis1.jpg)

Figure 1: Average time spent on school work(min) measured each day of the week Sunday-Friday. The response variable is time spent on school(min) and the predictor variable is the day of week. Small circles represent the individual observations for time spent on school work each day. The red point represents the mean time spent on school work for each week day.
