## Data Visualiation

This code displayed visualizes the time I spend on school work each day of the week. I created a  plot where the day of week is on the x-axis and time spent on homework is non the y-axis. The jittered points represent individually time spent each day. The red points represent the mean time each day spent on school work

```{r eval=FALSE}
mydata$day.of.week <- factor(mydata$day.of.week,
                             levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
                                        "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday",
                                        "Sunday")) 

mean_data <- mydata |>
  group_by(day.of.week) |>
  summarize(mean_time = mean(Time.spent.on.Schoolwork.min.))

ggplot(mydata,
       aes(x = day.of.week,
           y = Time.spent.on.Schoolwork.min.,
           color = day.of.week)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1,
              height = 0,
              alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(data = mean_data, aes(y = mean_time), shape = 16, size = 3, color = "red") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Monday" = "magenta",
    "Tuesday" = "orange",
    "Wednesday" = "gold",
    "Thursday" = "green",
    "Friday" = "darkblue",
    "Saturday" = "black",
    "Sunday" = "turquoise"
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Time Spent on School Work by Day of Week",
    x = "Day of the Week",
    color = "Day of Week",
    y = "Time Spent on School Work (min)"
  )
```
